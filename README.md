# Predictive Modeling Temperature of London

**All rights of idea and dataset are reserved to DataCamp**

**What I learnt/applied:**
- What was new here to me is : tuning different regressors, tracking the results (RMSE) using MLflow, and imputing the missing values using SimpleImputer().

** Insructions of the project were:**

Use machine learning to predict the mean temperature in London, England, logging your root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics using mlflow.

Build a model to predict "mean_temp" with a RMSE of 3 or less.
Use MLflow to log any models you train, their hyperparameters, and respective RMSE scores (ensuring you include "rmse" as part of the metric name).
Search all of your mlflow runs and store the results as a variable called experiment_results.
